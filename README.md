Talk for [EuroBSDcon 2014](http://2014.eurobsdcon.org/)

You can see this online at [Running Applications on the NetBSD Rump Kernel](http://eurobsdcon.myriabit.eu/)

The NetBSD rump kernel has been developed for some years now, allowing NetBSD kernel drivers to be used unmodified in many environments, for example as userspace code. However it is only since last year that it has become possible to easily run unmodified applications on the rump kernel, initially with the rump kernel on Xen port, and then with the rumprun tools to run them in userspace on Linux, FreeBSD and NetBSD. This talk will look at how this is achieved, and look at use cases, including kernel driver development, and lightweight process virtualization.
